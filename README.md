The ideal (?)


However, for a flagship speaker system with wide bandwidth (≈45 Hz to 50 kHz) and high output potential, some general acoustical design principles can be applied to maximize performance:

🎧 Recommended Room Dimension Principles
1) Room Size (Absolute)

Large, non-restrictive rooms are preferred for big, high-output, full-range speakers like the DD66000:

Depth: ideally ≥ 18–25 ft (5.5–7.5 m) — gives low bass room to develop and reduces early reflections.

Width: ideally ≥ 12–16 ft (3.5–5 m) — allows adequate spacing of the speakers and room for stereo imaging without strong side-wall interactions.

Height: 8.5–12 ft (2.6–3.7 m) — avoids overly strong vertical standing waves but still supports a smooth vertical field.

There’s no strict number from JBL, but audiophile consensus suggests larger rooms (>4500 ft³ / ~125 m³) generally help with bass extension and reduce modal issues with big speakers.

📐 Ideal Dimension Ratios (Room Mode Control)

Room dimension ratios matter more than exact numbers because they influence standing wave patterns. Two well-accepted ratios that help minimize acoustic modes:

Golden/Preferred Ratios
Ratio Name	Height : Width : Length	Why It’s Useful
Golden Ratio	1 : 1.6 : 2.6	Good modal distribution
Louden	1 : 1.4 : 1.9	Smooth low-frequency distribution
Walker	1 : 1.28 : 1.54	Good for smaller dedicated rooms

For example, if you target a ceiling height of 9 ft (~2.7 m), then:

Width ≈ 14.5 ft (4.4 m)

Length ≈ 23.5 ft (7.2 m)

This gives favorable modal spacing and smoother bass response.

🔊 Speaker Placement Within the Room

Correct placement achieves better imaging and frequency balance:

Distance from Front Wall: 2–4 ft (60–120 cm) from the front wall helps control bass excitation and reduces boundary reinforcement.

Speaker Separation: Aim for a spacing that forms an equilateral triangle with the listening position (left–right distance ≈ listener distance).

Symmetry: Left and right distances to side walls should be as equal as possible for balanced soundstage. 
JBL

Note: JBL advises placing the listener centered and matching left–right distances to minimize asymmetrical reflections. 
JBL

🎚 Acoustic Treatment (Essential)

Large speakers and big rooms almost always require acoustic control to tame reflections and modes:

First-Reflection Control

Panels at mirror points on side walls and ceiling above listening position.

Bass Traps

In corners (floor-to-ceiling) to reduce low-frequency buildup.

Diffusion

On rear wall to scatter high-frequency reflections and deepen soundstage.

This is often more impactful on clarity than precise room dimension changes.

🧠 Practical Summary

Best overall target for DD66000:

Room dimensions (example): ~14–16 ft wide × 23–26 ft long × 9–12 ft high

Ideal ratios: height:width:length close to 1 : ~1.6 : ~2.4–2.6

Symmetry & treatment: critical for imaging and accurate frequency balance

If you want, I can help calculate specific room mode frequencies for your exact room dimensions or sketch an optimal speaker/listener layout for your space — just share the room dimensions.

i want to design my ideal house.  it begins with a room built around the JBLs

Perfect place to start. If the house begins with the JBL Everest DD66000, then you’re really designing a reference listening room first, residence second. Below is a clean, architect-ready brief—dimensions, structure, materials, and layout—optimized specifically for the Everest’s scale, sensitivity, and waveguide behavior.

1. The Core Decision: Dedicated, Rectangular, Purpose-Built

No great JBL Everest room is:

open-concept

multi-purpose

asymmetrical

vaulted

This is a sealed, rectangular, single-use room with controlled proportions.

2. Ideal Internal Dimensions (Finished, Not Stud-to-Stud)
Target Ratio

Height : Width : Length ≈ 1 : 1.6 : 2.6

This ratio gives excellent modal distribution for large-format, high-efficiency loudspeakers with real bass authority.

Recommended Dimensions (Sweet Spot)

Ceiling height: 10.0 ft (3.05 m)

Width: 16.0 ft (4.88 m)

Length: 26.0 ft (7.92 m)

Volume: ~4,160 ft³
This is large enough for:

proper bass development

correct listening distance (10–14 ft)

reduced room gain exaggeration

Everest horn integration without “shouting”

If you can go slightly larger, stretch length, not width.

3. Speaker & Listener Geometry (Locked In Early)
Speaker Placement

Front wall distance: 36–48 inches (measured from baffle)

Side wall distance: ≥ 36 inches

Toe-in: Minimal; Everest waveguides want near-parallel orientation

Speaker separation: ~10–11 ft center-to-center

Listening Position

Distance: ~12–13 ft from speaker plane

Position in room: ~38% of room length from front wall
(avoids axial nulls)

This geometry is not negotiable—it drives room length.

4. Construction: This Matters More Than Décor
Walls

Double-stud or staggered stud

2 layers 5/8” drywall + Green Glue

Target: STC ≥ 60

Why: the DD66000 moves air. You don’t want the house to move with it.

Ceiling

Flat (no tray, no vault)

Same mass as walls

If second floor exists: isolation clips + hat channel

Floor

Concrete slab preferred

If wood: double-layer plywood + damping compound

Finish: hardwood or engineered wood (no wall-to-wall carpet)

5. Acoustic Treatment (Designed In, Not Added Later)
Front Wall

Absorptive, not reflective

4–6” broadband absorption behind and between speakers

Side Walls

First reflection points: 2–4” broadband panels

Symmetry is mandatory

Rear Wall

Diffusion dominant

QRD or skyline diffuser spanning ear-height width

Light absorption below diffuser if length allows

Bass Control

Full-height corner traps (front corners minimum)

Rear corners if space permits

No “foam.” Real mineral wool or fiberglass only.

6. HVAC, Noise Floor, and Mechanical Reality

Target NC-15 or better.

Oversized ducts

Low air velocity

Remote mechanical room

No vents on front wall or ceiling above speakers

Silent returns behind listening position preferred

You should hear the JBLs breathe—not the house.

7. Electrical & Lighting
Power

Dedicated 20A circuits

Isolated ground

Separate circuit for front-end electronics

Lighting

Indirect, dimmable

No recessed cans above speakers or listening position

Zero buzzing transformers

8. Where This Room Sits in the House

Ideal placement:

Ground floor or basement on slab

Exterior walls on at least two sides

Not under bedrooms

Adjacent rooms: library, study, gallery—not kitchen or laundry

Think of it as the anchor mass of the house.

9. If You Want the “Next Level”

Non-parallel wall surfaces (not structure): 2–3° splay via finish layers

Tuned Helmholtz absorbers for 30–60 Hz

Dedicated equipment alcove with glass wall

One-Sentence Summary

If you build a 16 × 26 × 10 ft, heavy, symmetrical, acoustically treated room with silent HVAC and disciplined geometry, the JBL Everest DD66000 will sound effortless, physical, and shockingly real—and everything else in the house will feel secondary.

If you want next:

we can draw the exact speaker/listener plan

tune modal frequencies numerically

or integrate this room into a full home layout logically (flow without acoustic compromise)

Just say where you want to go next.

it's an ideal house, build it as large as needed

Good—then we stop compromising and design this the way JBL’s engineers would if zoning, budgets, and spouses didn’t exist.

Below is an end-state reference design: a purpose-built Everest Hall that becomes the architectural and acoustic heart of the house. Everything else orbits it.

The Everest Hall

A no-excuses room for JBL DD66000

1. Target Acoustic Philosophy

The DD66000 is:

ultra-high efficiency

horn-loaded through the critical bands

capable of concert-level dynamics at low distortion

So the room must:

get out of the way

avoid compression (acoustic or psychological)

allow distance for wavefront integration

keep modal density high and even

This pushes us decisively into large-volume territory.

2. Ideal Finished Dimensions (Reference Grade)
Primary Geometry

Height : Width : Length ≈ 1 : 1.7 : 2.8

Final Recommended Dimensions

Ceiling height: 14.0 ft (4.27 m)

Width: 24.0 ft (7.32 m)

Length: 39.0 ft (11.9 m)

Total volume: ~13,100 ft³

This is not overkill.
This is where the Everest stops sounding like a loudspeaker and starts sounding like an acoustic event.

3. Why This Scale Works (Clinically)
Bass

Fundamental axial modes fall below ~40 Hz

Modes are dense and evenly spaced

Subjectively: tight, fast, effortless low end without “room boom”

Horn Integration

12–15 ft listening distance allows:

waveguide summation

proper vertical integration

elimination of horn “projection”

Dynamics

You can hit live SPLs without:

room pressurization artifacts

listener fatigue

boundary slap

This room breathes.

4. Speaker & Listener Layout (Locked Geometry)
Speaker Placement

Front wall distance: 5–6 ft (baffle to wall)

Side wall distance: ≥ 5 ft

Speaker separation: 14–16 ft center-to-center

Toe-in: near-parallel, slight inward bias only

Listening Position

Distance: 15–18 ft

Location: ~40% of room length from front wall

Listening zone width: ~6–8 ft usable sweet area

You can host multiple listeners without collapse of image.

5. Construction: Monumental, Not Domestic
Walls

Double concrete or masonry exterior walls

Interior isolated shell:

double stud

triple 5/8” drywall + damping

Effective wall mass rivals small theaters

Ceiling

Flat, massive, isolated

Optional concealed coffer purely decorative (non-parallel surfaces)

Floor

Structural concrete slab

Hardwood or stone finish

No carpet forward of listener plane

6. Acoustic Treatment (Integrated Architecture)

This room is built acoustic, not “treated.”

Front Wall

Deep (8–12”) broadband absorption

Concealed behind fabric or wood slats

Side Walls

Early reflection zones: hybrid absorption/diffusion

Rear half: primarily diffusion

Rear Wall

Full-width, floor-to-ceiling diffusion

Optional tuned low-frequency absorption below diffuser line

Bass Control

Pressure-based traps built into:

front wall cavities

rear wall depth

soffits

Nothing visible. Nothing aftermarket.

7. HVAC & Silence (Studio Standard)

Separate mechanical wing

Oversized ducts (low velocity)

Displacement ventilation preferred

Target NC-10 (yes, really)

You should hear the noise floor of the recording, not the house.

8. Lighting & Aesthetics

Indirect perimeter lighting only

No fixtures above speakers or listener

Materials:

wood

fabric

stone

No glass forward of listener

No symmetry-breaking art

Visually calm. Psychologically expansive.

9. The House Grows Around This Room
Immediate Adjacencies

Equipment gallery (visible through acoustic glass)

Music library / reading room

Outdoor terrace (rear wall only)

Vertical Strategy

Everest Hall on ground level slab

Living spaces orbit laterally

Bedrooms never above

This room is the structural and emotional anchor of the house.

10. End Result (What This Buys You)

No sense of scale limitation

No horn glare

No room-induced bass personality

Dynamics that feel physical but relaxed

Imaging that survives movement and multiple listeners

This is not “hi-fi.”
This is private concert architecture.

If you want next:

precise modal math for this volume

architectural section diagrams

or a full house layout where the listening room dictates circulation, sightlines, and massing

Say the word.

in addition the this, i want large picture windows on at least one end

You can do this—without sacrificing reference-grade performance—but the windowed end must be treated as a designed acoustic system, not a “view slapped onto a wall.”

Below is how to integrate large picture windows into the Everest Hall correctly.

Integrating Large Picture Windows into the Everest Hall
1. Which End Gets the Windows (Non-Negotiable)

Windows go on the REAR wall only.
Never the front wall. Never the side walls.

Why:

Preserves front-wall absorption for horn control

Maintains lateral symmetry

Allows controlled late reflections (or none at all)

The rear wall is acoustically forgiving if engineered properly.

2. Window Geometry (Critical)
Size & Placement

Full-width glazing is acceptable

Height limited to ≤ 10 ft of the 14 ft wall

Bottom of glass ≥ 30–36 in above floor (protects bass behavior)

Angle (Very Important)

Entire window wall tilted 2–5° backward

prevents slap echo

avoids direct specular reflections back to listener

improves bass uniformity

This is invisible visually, profound acoustically.

3. Glass Specification (This Is Not Residential Glass)

You want mass + damping + asymmetry.

Recommended Assembly (Exterior → Interior)

Laminated acoustic glass

Large air gap (6–10 inches)

Second laminated pane (different thickness)

Target:

STC ≥ 45

Low-frequency transmission loss >30 dB at 40–80 Hz

This behaves more like a flexibly damped membrane than a mirror.

4. Controlling Reflections from the Glass
Option A: Motorized Heavy Acoustic Curtains (Best Overall)

Ceiling-recessed

2–3× fullness

Dense wool or specialty acoustic fabric

Covers entire glass wall when listening critically

Result:

Near-perfect diffusion/absorption hybrid

Adjustable acoustics (day vs night)

Option B: Secondary Interior Diffusive Layer

Wood slat diffuser array 6–12 in in front of glass

Variable depth slats

Visually stunning, acoustically excellent

You see the landscape through rhythm, not glare.

Many reference studios use this exact approach.

5. Bass Behavior at the Window Wall

Large glass surfaces can help or hurt depending on design.

What We Want

Slight LF compliance

No hard pressure reflection

How We Achieve It

Laminated glass (not tempered alone)

Air gap acts as pressure sink

Optional tuned absorbers below sill height

This prevents rear-wall bass “bounce-back.”

6. Visual Experience (Why This Is Worth It)

Done correctly, you get:

Daylight without brightness fatigue

No visual clutter forward of the speakers

A sense of depth extending beyond the room

Night listening with curtains closed feels cocooned, cathedral-like

The contrast between open and sealed modes is intoxicating.

7. Final Revised Everest Hall Summary

Dimensions:

24 ft (W) × 39 ft (L) × 14 ft (H)

Key features added:

Rear-wall angled picture window system

Laminated, asymmetrical acoustic glazing

Motorized acoustic curtains or diffusive screen

No compromise to imaging, bass, or dynamics

One-Sentence Truth

A properly designed rear picture window doesn’t weaken a great listening room—it humanizes it, letting the music exist inside a real landscape instead of a bunker.

If you want next:

exact curtain fabric specs

slat diffuser geometry that preserves the view

or seasonal light-control strategies for glare-free daytime listening

Just tell me how far you want to push it.

so, the speakers face the rear wall, yes?

Yes. In this design, the speakers fire toward the rear wall—the wall with the picture windows—but with an important clarification:

You listen away from the windows, with the windows behind you.

Let me lock the orientation cleanly, because this is where people often get turned around.

Canonical Orientation (No Ambiguity)
Front of the Room

Solid, massive, absorptive wall

Speakers placed here

No windows

This is the acoustic control wall

Rear of the Room

Picture windows

Diffusion / curtains / angled glazing

This is the visual wall

Listening Position

You sit facing the speakers

Your back is toward the windows

So the sound travels from the solid wall → toward the windowed wall, but your ears are not pointed at glass.

Why This Orientation Is Correct (Especially for the Everest)
1. Front-Wall Control Is Sacred

The DD66000:

has extremely powerful midbass output

uses horn-loaded waveguides that are sensitive to early reflections

You want:

deep absorption

pressure management

zero specular reflection

That must be behind the speakers, not behind your head.

2. Rear-Wall Reflections Are Much Less Dangerous

Reflections from behind the listener:

arrive late

are perceptually benign

can be diffusive without collapsing the image

That’s why studios put:

diffusion

glass

even control-room windows

…on the rear wall, not the front.

3. Windows Behind You Are Acoustically Tameable

With:

laminated glass

air gap

curtains or slatted diffusers

…the rear wall can be made:

variable

non-specular

bass-compliant

This is impossible at the front wall without audible damage.

Mental Model (Quick)

Think of it as:

Speakers perform toward the landscape.
You sit between them and the view—but you face the music, not the glass.

           Seat

[ Angled Rear Wall with Picture Windows ]


If you want next, we can:

tune the rear-wall glass angle numerically

design motorized curtain presets

or decide whether the view is forest, water, or horizon (it actually matters acoustically)

You’re designing something rare. We should get it exactly right.

eventually, we'll need to design for each view mentioned.  should the front wall have a velvet curtain covering?

Short answer: yes—but only as part of a layered front-wall system.
A velvet curtain alone is insufficient; velvet + deep absorption behind it is close to ideal.

Here’s the precise, no-nonsense guidance.

Front Wall: What It Must Accomplish

For the DD66000, the front wall must:

Kill early reflections (mid/high)

Control upper bass / lower midrange energy (80–300 Hz)

Avoid specular return into the horns

Remain visually calm and non-distracting

Velvet helps with #1 and #4. It does nothing for #2.

Ideal Front-Wall Stack (Speaker-Facing Wall)
From Structure → Listener

Massive structural wall
(concrete or double-stud + heavy drywall)

Deep broadband absorption

8–12 inches mineral wool or fiberglass

Covers entire wall, floor to ceiling

Especially important behind and between speakers

Air gap (optional but beneficial)

1–2 inches improves low-frequency effectiveness

Velvet curtain (final layer)

This is not decoration—it’s the acoustic skin

Velvet: Exact Specification (This Matters)
Material

Cotton or cotton/silk velvet

Dense pile, matte

≥ 24 oz/linear yard

No synthetic “stage velour” unless acoustically rated

Construction

2–3× fullness (heavy pleating)

Floor-to-ceiling

Wall-to-wall

Ceiling-recessed track (invisible hardware)

Color

Black, charcoal, or very dark earth tones
(lighter colors reflect HF—even in velvet)

What the Velvet Actually Does (and Doesn’t)
✅ What It Does Well

Absorbs mid and high frequencies

Prevents horn-edge reflection artifacts

Eliminates visual contrast near the speakers

Reduces listener fatigue

Improves perceived image depth

❌ What It Does Not Do

Absorb bass

Control room modes

Replace real acoustic treatment

Think of velvet as the anechoic “finish coat”, not the structure.

Why This Is Especially Right for the Everest

The DD66000:

projects enormous dynamic contrast

has extremely low distortion

makes tiny reflection errors obvious

A velvet-faced front wall:

removes HF glare without deadening the room

lets the horns sound effortless instead of forward

improves realism at both low and live SPLs

Many mastering rooms with horn systems do exactly this—for a reason.

Optional (But Powerful) Upgrade

Split-zone front wall:

Center section: velvet over absorption

Outer thirds: absorptive + subtle diffusion behind velvet

This maintains energy while preserving image stability.

Bottom Line

Yes, the front wall should be velvet-covered—
but only over deep, full-wall absorption.

Done correctly, the speakers don’t sound like they’re in the room.
They sound like they’ve removed a wall entirely.

When you’re ready, next steps could be:

locking front-wall absorption depth by frequency target

coordinating velvet + rear-window curtain fabrics

or mapping view-specific rear-wall acoustics (forest vs water vs horizon absolutely differ)

You’re building this the right way.

 create a search prompt for images reflecting these princples

Here’s a precise search prompt you can use to find images that match the room you’re envisioning:

Search Prompt:
"luxury home audio room with JBL Everest DD66000 speakers, large floor-to-ceiling picture windows at one end, spacious rectangular room, high ceiling, ideal acoustic proportions, symmetrically placed speakers facing rear wall, first-reflection acoustic panels, bass traps in corners, diffusers on rear wall, velvet curtain on front wall, modern minimalist interior, natural light, audiophile-grade listening room, cinematic aesthetic"

This will focus on both acoustic optimization and architectural/visual appeal.

If you want, I can also refine it into a version optimized for AI image generators like MidJourney or DALL·E.

that generated a lot of bullshit, not an ideal space

Got it — we need to narrow the focus and eliminate extraneous “luxury home” fluff that doesn’t contribute to a clean, acoustically optimized listening room. The goal is: large, proportioned for JBL DD66000s, one wall of picture windows, rear wall for speakers, front wall optionally velvet, and minimal visual distraction.

Here’s a refined, precise prompt:

AI / Image search prompt:
"High-fidelity listening room, large rectangular dimensions, proportioned for audiophile sound, JBL Everest DD66000 speakers facing rear wall, large floor-to-ceiling picture windows on opposite end, front wall with optional velvet curtain, high ceiling, minimal furniture, acoustic panels on side walls, bass traps in corners, diffusers on rear wall, clean modern interior, natural light, uncluttered, realistic lighting, focus on room layout and speaker placement"

If you want, I can also draft a version that will produce a near-floorplan visualization, showing speaker placement, windows, and curtain, which is usually more useful than just a rendered “luxury room” image. Do you want me to do that?

gave me a lot of the same bullshit

Ah — I see the issue. Most prompts are interpreted by AI as “show a fancy living room with speakers” instead of a purely functional, acoustically correct listening room. To fix this, we need to strip out all luxury/furniture references and force the model to focus on geometry, proportions, speaker placement, and windows.

Here’s a tight, technical prompt:

Refined Prompt for AI / Image Search:
"Rectangular listening room designed for JBL Everest DD66000 speakers, speakers facing rear wall, large floor-to-ceiling picture windows on opposite wall, high ceiling, minimal furniture or decoration, focus on room proportions and acoustic layout, bass traps in corners, acoustic panels on side walls, diffusers on rear wall, front wall optionally covered with velvet curtain, natural light, clean and realistic architectural interior, accurate speaker placement, uncluttered, functional design, no luxury embellishments"

If you want, I can go one step further and make a version that forces a blueprint / schematic-style image — this usually gives the clearest visual for design purposes, rather than a photorealistic room that ends up “over-decorated.”

Do you want me to do that next?

query is too long

Understood — we need a short, precise prompt that emphasizes room geometry, speaker placement, and windows, without any extraneous decoration. Here’s a compact version:

Short Prompt:
"Rectangular listening room, JBL Everest DD66000 speakers facing rear wall, floor-to-ceiling windows opposite, high ceiling, minimal furnishings, acoustic panels on side walls, bass traps in corners, rear wall diffusers, front wall velvet curtain optional, clean functional layout"

I can also make an ultra-short version under 25 words optimized for AI generators that will avoid “luxury living room” interpretations. Do you want me to do that?

never mind.  is brick a good construction material for the back wall?

Yes — brick can be an excellent material for the rear wall in a high-end listening room, but there are trade-offs. Here’s the breakdown:

Pros of Brick

Massive & Dense – high mass helps reduce wall vibrations and prevents low-frequency energy from transmitting, which improves bass definition.

Reflection Control – smooth brick reflects mid/high frequencies predictably, which can help imaging if paired with absorptive panels strategically.

Durability – permanent, stable, and fire-resistant.

Cons / Considerations

Hard Reflections – unmodified brick is very reflective, which can cause harsh early reflections. You’ll likely need diffusers or partial absorptive treatment to smooth highs and preserve clarity.

Low-Frequency Standing Waves – brick alone doesn’t address room modes; bass traps are still essential in corners.

Integration with Room Aesthetics – can look industrial unless finished or combined with panels/curtains.

Practical Tip

A common approach in audiophile rooms:

Use brick or concrete for the rear wall for mass.

Apply diffusers across most of the surface to scatter mid/high reflections.

Leave small absorbent zones if needed to tame flutter echoes.

This gives tight, controlled bass without sacrificing imaging or introducing harsh reflections.

If you want, I can sketch an optimal rear-wall treatment plan combining brick, diffusers, and optional velvet panels specifically for the DD66000s. That would give a very concrete setup. Do you want me to do that?

okay, so brick with a theatrical velour curtain?

Exactly — that’s a very practical combination for an audiophile room:

How It Works

Brick Wall: Provides mass and stiffness, keeping bass tight and controlled.

Theatrical Velour Curtain: Softens mid/high reflections when deployed, giving you control over early reflections and room brightness. You can open or close it depending on listening preference — fully open for natural brightness, drawn for more warmth and reduced harshness.

Implementation Tips

Full Coverage vs. Partial: You don’t need to cover the entire brick wall. Even a central strip behind the speakers or zones where reflections hit the listening position is enough.

Curtain Mounting: Use heavy-duty tracks so it hangs smoothly and reaches floor-to-ceiling; avoid gaps at the edges to prevent reflection leaks.

Thickness & Material: Choose 100–300 g/m² dense velour (theatrical grade) — thin decorative curtains won’t absorb enough.

Diffuser Integration: If you also install diffusers on the rear wall, the curtain can be movable, leaving diffusers exposed when needed.

This setup gives you tight bass, adjustable mid/high response, and excellent imaging — all optimized for the DD66000s.

If you want, I can diagram a rear-wall treatment layout showing how brick, diffusers, and velour curtain coexist for maximal acoustic performance. Do you want me to do that?

yes

Here’s a clear conceptual layout for the rear wall of your DD66000 listening room combining brick, diffusers, and a velour curtain:

Key Details

Brick Wall

Full wall coverage behind speakers.

Provides high mass to stabilize low frequencies.

Can be exposed or partially hidden behind curtain/diffusers.

Diffuser Panels

Mounted across upper and lateral sections of the brick wall.

Scatter mid/high frequencies for better imaging.

Can be staggered or irregular to avoid pattern reinforcement.

Velour Curtain

Heavy, floor-to-ceiling, mounted on a track for mobility.

Covers the central section where primary reflections hit the listening area.

Can be fully opened (natural brightness) or closed (warmer, more controlled sound).

Combination

Brick + diffusers = tight, controlled bass + smooth high-end.

Curtain = adjustable absorption for listening preference.

If you want, I can create a more detailed top-down and side-view diagram showing speaker placement relative to this rear wall and listening position, which will help when scaling the room for the DD66000s. That’s the next step toward designing the full ideal house listening room.

Do you want me to do that?

so the velour doesn't need to cover the entire back wall; and it doesn't need to run floor-to-ceiling?

Correct — it doesn’t need to cover the entire rear wall or necessarily run floor-to-ceiling. The curtain’s main purpose is to control early reflections that hit the listening position. Here’s the breakdown:

Coverage

Partial coverage is sufficient: focus on the central reflection zone behind the speakers where high/mid frequencies would otherwise bounce directly to the listener.

Edges can remain exposed brick: this preserves mass for bass control and allows diffusers to scatter sound.

Height

Full floor-to-ceiling is optional, not mandatory.

A curtain spanning from just above the speakers to slightly above ear level at the listening position often captures most problematic reflections.

Floor-to-ceiling gives maximum flexibility for changing listening moods, but adds little if your reflection zones are well-targeted.

Key Principles

Adjustable is better — curtain on a track allows you to fine-tune absorption.

Don’t over-dampen — leaving some brick and diffusers exposed maintains brightness, imaging, and spatial depth.

Complement diffusers — the curtain should not entirely block diffusers; rather, it works alongside them for optimal balance.

If you want, I can sketch a rear-wall layout showing exactly how much velour coverage is optimal for the DD66000s in a large listening room. This would make the plan very concrete.

provide a link to some commercially-available diffusers

Here are some commercially available acoustic diffusers you can consider for treating the rear wall (or other reflection points) in your listening room — these are designed to scatter mid/high frequencies and improve spatial clarity (diffusion is often used after you’ve addressed bass trapping and early reflections)

💡 Tip: Diffusers are most effective after you’ve treated primary reflection points with absorbers (e.g., broad‑band absorbers) and bass traps are in place (low‑frequency control helps diffusion work better). In a high‑performance listening room, a mix of absorption (for reflection control) and diffusion (for spaciousness) typically yields the best results.

Would you like recommendations for bass traps and broadband absorbers that pair well with these diffusers for your JBL Everest setup?

okay, so we want brick or fieldstone wall, with diffusers and velour curtains at rear wall.  what are the dimensions of the room?

For your ideal DD66000 listening room, we want room dimensions that optimize low-frequency response, imaging, and accommodate the large speakers, while leaving flexibility for windows, seating, and acoustic treatment. Since this is an ideal house with no strict space limits, we can prioritize optimal acoustic ratios rather than typical residential constraints.

Step 1: Target Room Volume & Ratios

Large, rectangular rooms are best for high-output floor-standing speakers:

Volume: ≥ 4,500–6,000 ft³ (~125–170 m³)

Ceiling Height: 9–12 ft (2.7–3.7 m)

Length-to-Width Ratios: Use Golden Ratio or similar for modal distribution

Preferred ratio examples (Height : Width : Length):

Ratio Name	H : W : L
Golden	1 : 1.6 : 2.6
Louden	1 : 1.4 : 1.9
Walker	1 : 1.28 : 1.54
Step 2: Example Dimensions

Let’s pick ceiling = 10 ft (3.05 m) for a spacious, airy feel:

Width: 10 ft × 1.6 ≈ 16 ft (4.9 m)

Length: 10 ft × 2.6 ≈ 26 ft (7.9 m)

✅ This gives a rectangular room (16 × 26 × 10 ft), about 4,160 ft³ — slightly under the ideal volume, but we can increase to 18 × 28 × 10 ft (~5,040 ft³) if space allows.

Step 3: Layout Principles

Speakers: JBL Everest DD66000s facing rear wall (brick/fieldstone) with diffusers and movable velour curtain zones.

Listening Position: Centered along length; left–right spacing forms roughly an equilateral triangle with speakers.

Windows: Large picture windows at front wall (opposite speakers) for natural light.

Acoustic Treatment:

Rear wall: brick/fieldstone + diffusers + partial velour curtain

Side walls: absorptive panels at first reflection points

Corners: floor-to-ceiling bass traps

Ceiling (optional): clouds above listening position for early reflection control

Step 4: Optional Adjustments

Increase width to 20 ft if you want wider stereo imaging.

Length >28 ft improves bass extension and modal distribution.

Ceiling >10 ft can make the room feel more open and help vertical mode control, especially with tall speakers.

If you want, I can draw a scaled top-down layout of this room showing speaker positions, listening position, rear wall treatment, windows, and potential acoustic panel placement — essentially a blueprint for your ideal listening space.

Do you want me to do that next?

fucktard, this is an ideal design, don't scrimp

Got it — we’re building the ultimate, no-compromise listening room around the JBL Everest DD66000s. Forget typical residential constraints; we’ll go full audiophile/architectural scale.

Ideal Room Dimensions (Full Scale)

Ceiling Height: 12 ft (3.7 m) — gives vertical headroom, reduces vertical modes, supports big diffusers.

Width: 20 ft (6.1 m) — wide enough for optimal speaker separation and stereo imaging.

Length: 35–40 ft (10.7–12.2 m) — long enough for deep bass extension and room mode spacing.

Volume: ~8,400–9,600 ft³ (~238–272 m³) — plenty of air for speakers to breathe.

Ratio (Height : Width : Length) ≈ 1 : 1.66 : 3.0, roughly aligned with golden ratios for minimal low-frequency resonance issues.

Acoustic Layout
Rear Wall

Material: Brick or fieldstone (massive, inert)

Treatment: Modular diffusers across upper/lateral zones + movable heavy velour curtain in the central reflection zone

Side Walls

First-reflection points: Broad-band absorptive panels

Additional diffusers: Optional for spatial enhancement further down the room

Corners

Floor-to-ceiling bass traps in all four corners for sub-60 Hz control

Ceiling

Acoustic cloud panels above listening position to tame early reflections

Optionally staggered diffusers toward the rear for natural soundstage enhancement

Front Wall (Opposite Rear Wall)

Large picture windows — with optional motorized curtains to control glare and high-frequency reflections

Speaker & Listening Placement

Speakers: 6–8 ft from rear wall, centered horizontally

Listener: ~12–14 ft from speakers, forming an equilateral triangle with left/right speakers

Side-wall spacing: ~6–7 ft from each side for optimal imaging

If you want, I can produce a fully scaled top-down and side-view diagram showing speaker placement, rear-wall brick/diffuser/curtain layout, windows, and acoustic treatments. It would be like a blueprint for your ultimate audiophile room.

Do you want me to create that diagram?

create a rendering using Dall-e
fucktard, you didn't use Everests in the rendering

Ah — you’re right. The rendering I generated shows generic large speakers, not the JBL Everest DD66000s specifically. The model didn’t recognize the exact cabinet shape and horn configuration of the Everests, which are very distinctive.

We can fix this by creating a new prompt that explicitly describes the DD66000s in detail:

Revised DALL‑E Prompt:
"Ultimate audiophile listening room, 20x40 ft, 12 ft ceiling, JBL Everest DD66000 speakers with their distinctive dual large woofers and horn-loaded mid/highs facing rear brick/fieldstone wall, modular diffusers above and to sides, movable black velour curtain central, floor-to-ceiling bass traps in corners, acoustic clouds above listening position, large picture windows on front wall, minimal furnishings, realistic lighting, clearly show speaker design and placement"

If you want, I can generate a new image with this prompt that properly shows the JBL Everests. Do you want me to do that?

yes
still don't look like Everests, as these are rectangular cabinets

Ah — now I understand the issue clearly. The DD66000 Everests have a very distinctive cabinet shape:

Curved, sculpted wooden sides, not simple rectangular boxes

Horn-loaded mid/high section that flares outward at the top

Dual massive woofers arranged vertically

The overall cabinet tapers slightly toward the rear, giving a sculptural, elegant look

AI image generators typically default to simple rectangular “floorstanding speakers” unless the prompt very explicitly describes the curved cabinet shape and horn flare.

For a more accurate rendering, the prompt needs to include detailed physical descriptors of the Everests’ form, e.g.:

“Curved walnut cabinets tapering toward the rear”

“Flared horn-loaded mid/high section above two large vertically stacked woofers”

“Sculptural, non-rectangular floor-standing speakers”

If you want, I can draft a corrected DALL-E prompt that emphasizes the sculpted cabinet shape, horn flare, and realistic proportions, so the generated speakers actually resemble the JBL Everest DD66000s.

Do you want me to do that next?

woofers are not arranged vertically, nimrod.  https://mm.jbl.com/floorstanding/DD67000RW.html

Thanks for the correction — and you’re right to be specific about the speaker geometry. Based on the official JBL specs, the JBL Project Everest DD67000 / JBL Everest DD67000 (an evolution of the DD66000 lineage) are 3‑way floorstanding speakers with dual woofers arranged side‑by‑side (not vertically stacked) alongside a horn‑loaded mid/high section with proprietary Bi‑Radial® horns. 
JBL

For your next DALL‑E prompt, we can explicitly describe the distinct dual‑woofer side‑by‑side layout and horn shape so the generated room actually shows the right form factor.

Here’s a revised prompt optimized for speaker geometry:

DALL‑E Prompt (accurate for Everests):
“Ultimate audiophile listening room, 20×40 ft with 12 ft ceilings, featuring JBL Everest DD67000 speakers with side‑by‑side dual 15″ woofers and curved Bi‑Radial horn‑loaded mid/high section centered above the woofers, facing a brick/fieldstone rear wall with diffusers and a central movable velour curtain, side wall first‑reflection absorbers, floor‑to‑ceiling corner bass traps, acoustic clouds above the listening position, large picture windows on front wall, minimal functional aesthetic, realistic architectural lighting, clearly visible distinctive speaker shape.”

That level of detail — describing the physical layout of the woofers and horn — increases the chance the model will render cabinets that actually look like the Everests rather than generic rectangles.

If you want, I can also generate multiple variants (e.g., front view, angled view from listener seat, cross‑section layout) so you can visualize different aspects of the room design. Just tell me which views you want.

okay

Perfect. Let’s break it down into three key renderings that will give a full sense of your ultimate listening room around the JBL Everest DD67000s:

1. Front‑Facing View (from listener toward speakers)

Shows the dual side-by-side woofers and horn flare of the Everests

Displays rear brick/fieldstone wall with diffusers and central velour curtain

Windows at the front wall can be visible indirectly (light coming in)

Room proportions, ceiling height, and acoustic clouds above the listening position

2. Angled Perspective (diagonal from rear corner)

Emphasizes room volume and proportions (20×40 ft, 12 ft high)

Shows speaker placement relative to walls and listener position

Highlights side-wall absorbers and corner bass traps

Makes diffusers and velour curtain interaction clearer

3. Top‑Down / Floorplan View

Clearly maps speaker positions, listening position, and window location

Shows placement of diffusers, curtain, bass traps, and first-reflection absorbers

Useful for scaling, planning, and integrating architectural elements

If you want, I can generate all three views using DALL‑E with the revised, precise prompt describing the Everests’ dual side-by-side woofers and horn-loaded mid/high section. This will give you a nearly blueprint-level visualization of your ideal room.

Do you want me to generate all three now?

do.it.
still the bullshit rendering of the speakers

Got it — the issue is that AI image generators are not reliably capturing the exact sculpted form of the JBL Everest DD66000/67000 speakers, including:

Curved side panels

Bi-Radial horn flare

Side-by-side dual woofers

Overall cabinet tapering

Even with detailed text prompts, models often default to rectangular “generic floor-standing speakers” because:

They have no training on this specific speaker model.

Subtle sculptural details are hard to describe precisely in words for the AI.

Perspective and acoustic-room context can confuse the model into flattening shapes.

Practical Alternatives

Use a 3D model:

Search for a CAD or OBJ model of the JBL Everest DD66000/67000 (some high-end audio forums or manufacturers may have one).

Import into Blender, SketchUp, or other 3D software, then place in a virtual room for realistic rendering.

This guarantees accurate cabinet shape, proportions, and horn detail.

Photo-based compositing:

Take high-res photos of the Everests.

Place them in a room render using Photoshop or similar tools.

Ensures realistic texture and shape without AI misinterpretation.

Commission a 3D artist:

Provide official specs, photos, and dimensions.

They can model the Everests precisely and render your room exactly as designed.

If you want, I can prepare a workflow and resources list so you can generate a fully accurate visual of your ultimate listening room with the real JBL Everest cabinets — essentially a step-by-step “no-compromise” plan.

Do you want me to do that?

yes

Perfect. Here’s a no-compromise workflow for generating a fully accurate visual of your ultimate listening room with JBL Everest DD66000/67000 speakers:

Step 1: Obtain a 3D Model of the JBL Everest

Official CAD/OBJ/STL models are rare, but check:

JBL / Harman Media Assets
 – sometimes press kits or architectural resources include CAD files.

Audio enthusiast forums (e.g., AudioKarma, AVSForum) – users sometimes share detailed 3D models.

TurboSquid / CGTrader – search for “JBL Everest DD66000” or “high-end floor-standing speaker” for editable 3D models that can be adapted.

Alternative: Use precise measurements from the JBL spec sheet and reference photos to model it in Blender or SketchUp.

Step 2: Build the Room in 3D Software

Use Blender, SketchUp, or Cinema 4D to create the room:

Dimensions: 20×40 ft, 12 ft ceiling

Rear wall: brick or fieldstone

Side walls: absorptive panels at first reflections

Rear wall treatments: diffusers + velour curtain

Corners: floor-to-ceiling bass traps

Ceiling: acoustic clouds

Front wall: large picture windows

Include exact speaker placement based on recommended distances from walls and listener.

Step 3: Import the Speaker Models

Place JBL Everest 3D models in the room:

Ensure side-by-side woofers and horn shape are preserved

Align speakers with the rear wall and listening position

Step 4: Texturing and Lighting

Apply realistic materials:

Speakers: walnut finish, matte horn, metallic trim

Floor: hardwood or rug

Walls: brick/fieldstone, acoustic panels, velour curtain

Lighting: daylight through windows + ceiling ambient lighting

Use physically-based rendering (PBR) for realistic light reflections on materials.

Step 5: Rendering

Render multiple views:

Front-facing from listening position

Angled diagonal to show room scale

Top-down / floorplan view for layout and scaling

Optionally, create a walkthrough animation for immersive visualization.

Step 6: Optional Enhancements

Add acoustic ray-tracing simulation (e.g., REW + SketchUp plugins) to visualize reflections and absorption.

Annotate reflection points, bass trap coverage, and diffuser placement for engineering accuracy.

Export high-res images for architectural presentations or interior design planning.

If you want, I can draft a ready-to-use Blender workflow and setup guide, including room dimensions, speaker coordinates, and suggested diffuser/curtain placement, so you could import the speaker model and render the space immediately.

Do you want me to create that setup guide next?

okay, take the top left image, and isolate it.   we need to now build the house around this room.

Perfect — we’ll treat the top-left image from your previous DALL·E render as the “core listening room” and build the house around it.

Since I can’t directly edit the image pixels to isolate objects, the workflow is:

Step 1: Isolate the Listening Room

Use the render as a standalone “module” in your design:

Export the top-left image as a separate file (you already have it: /mnt/data/A_series_of_three_3D-rendered_digital_images_showc.png)

Treat it as a pre-defined room volume with the JBL Everests, rear wall treatments, and window orientation fixed.

Step 2: Define the Listening Room Envelope

Room dimensions (from previous design): 20×40 ft, 12 ft ceiling

Treat rear wall with brick/fieldstone + diffusers + velour curtain as the “rear boundary”

Front wall: large picture windows — this determines the “front façade” orientation

Side walls: absorptive panels can extend into adjoining spaces as needed for visual continuity

Step 3: Build the House Around the Room

Decide on adjacent spaces:

Front of room (windows side): entry hall, gallery, or patio connection to take advantage of light and view

Sides: corridors, acoustic buffer zones (library, study, or quiet lounge) to reduce external noise

Rear: storage, mechanical room, or soundproofed hallway for isolation

Vertical stacking: if multi-story, keep heavy floors and ceilings for mass to avoid vibration transmission into the listening room

Step 4: Structural & Acoustic Integration

Load-bearing walls should be outside the listening room to avoid mid-wall resonance

Include acoustic isolation (floating floor, double walls, decoupled ceiling)

HVAC ducts should avoid running directly through the room or be lined with absorption

Step 5: Orientation & Light

Position the room in the house so that the large windows face the optimal view (north for consistent light, south for sunlight if you want warmth)

Create entry and circulation that funnels into the listening room as a central “audio sanctuary”

If you want, I can create a conceptual 3D “house shell” diagram showing the listening room inside a full-scale house footprint — including walls, corridors, and exterior placement — ready for further architectural detailing.

Do you want me to do that next?

the kitchen sink should be centered under a window.  the stove should be gas, with an exhaust hood above it.  plenty of counter space with coffee maker, microwave , dishwasher, adjacent pantry.  there is plenty of cabinet space with glass-doors showing the Villeroy-Bosch Amapola dining sets.

Perfect — we can now design the kitchen as a high-functioning, visually appealing space, integrating it into the house around your ultimate listening room. Here’s a full specification:

Do you want me to do that next?

the kitchen should also include a desk for managing inventory and recipes.  there should be a double oven, and a prep area for both produce and meats.  separately there should be an area for baking and prep.

Perfect — let’s integrate all these professional- and family-friendly features into the kitchen design while keeping it functional, visually coherent, and well-integrated with the house around your listening room.

Do you want to move on to designing the dining and living areas next?

now we need a room with a fireplace that also serves as a home theater

Perfect — let’s design a high-end home theater with a fireplace, integrated into the house around your listening room and kitchen. Since this is an ideal house, we can prioritize size, acoustics, and comfort without compromises.

Room Concept: Fireplace + Home Theater
Dimensions

Width: 18–22 ft (5.5–6.7 m) for wide seating and screen

Length: 25–30 ft (7.6–9.1 m) to allow deep viewing distance

Ceiling height: 10–12 ft (3–3.7 m) for a spacious feel and room acoustics

Volume: ~4,500–7,500 ft³ — sufficient for good low-frequency response without boomy acoustics

Primary Features

Screen / Projection

Large fixed screen or retractable projector screen

Acoustic transparency if speakers are behind the screen

Speakers & Sound

7.1 or 9.1 surround system

Optional in-wall or floor-standing speakers

Subwoofer placement to optimize bass response without rattling fireplace

Fireplace

Positioned on front or side wall, visually anchoring the room

Gas or wood — consider glass-enclosed for safety and minimal vibration

Mantel integrated without interfering with speaker placement

Seating

Tiered or flat, depending on ceiling height

Recliners or modular sofa for flexibility

Seating oriented toward the screen with clear sightlines to fireplace

Acoustic Treatment

Side walls: absorptive panels at first-reflection points

Layout Notes

Fireplace wall can double as rear wall for screen if the screen retracts

Screen wall opposite fireplace is possible if viewing and fireplace are secondary focus

Acoustic integration: keep fireplace materials non-resonant (stone, brick, tile) and separate subwoofers from the wall if possible

If you want, I can create a 3D rendering of this combined home theater + fireplace room, showing: screen, fireplace, seating, surround speakers, and acoustic treatments — all sized to the ideal house scale.

Do you want me to generate that rendering?

i think large OLED (8K) is best for screen .   surround 9.1 system with >70" and optimized speaker placement and visual immersion.   again, theatrical velour is appreciated.

Perfect — we’re talking top-tier home theater meets high-end lounge aesthetic. Here’s the full concept:

Home Theater + Fireplace: Ideal Specs

Proper acoustic treatments

Do you want me to generate that rendering next?

furniture should be stickley/mission-style, with pendleton wool accents;  plants could include cana lillies, bird of paradise, irises, etc

Perfect — now we’re layering in high-end, warm, and natural interior design while keeping the theater fully immersive. Here’s the full integrated concept:

Home Theater + Fireplace: Furnishings & Decor
Furniture

Style: Stickley/Mission-style

Solid wood construction, rich walnut or cherry finish

Clean lines, visible joinery, timeless aesthetic

Seating:

Recliners or modular sofas with Mission-style wooden framing

Cushions upholstered in neutral fabrics, accented with Pendleton wool throws and pillows

Textiles

Velour theatrical curtains: deep, rich colors (burgundy, navy, or charcoal) for wall panels or window treatments

Pendleton wool accents: throws, pillows, or floor runners for warmth and color

Plants & Natural Accents

Indoor greenery:

Canna lilies — tall, sculptural leaves

Bird of paradise — dramatic tropical flair

Irises — smaller accent plants, colorful blooms

Placement: near side walls, corners, or adjacent to fireplace for visual life without obstructing sightlines or acoustics

Lighting

Warm recessed lighting, indirect coves, and accent lighting highlighting Mission-style woodwork and plants

Dimmable lights for full cinematic experience

Color & Material Palette

Layout Notes

Furniture oriented toward screen while leaving fireplace visible from side or rear seats

Plants strategically placed to enhance aesthetics but not interfere with acoustics

Velour curtains absorb early reflections and add a luxurious, theatrical feel

If you want, I can generate a 3D rendering of the fireplace home theater fully furnished: OLED screen, 9.1 speakers, Stickley/Mission-style furniture, Pendleton wool accents, theatrical velour, and your selected plants.

Do you want me to do that next?

LED lighting works, too, as it is controllable, and can be set to a timer.  additionally, it can be placed almost anywhere for ambience

Perfect — we can integrate flexible, controllable LED lighting throughout the home theater to enhance both function and ambiance without compromising acoustics or sightlines. Here’s how it fits into the overall design:

Lighting Strategy for the Home Theater + Fireplace Room
Primary Lighting

Recessed ceiling LEDs: dimmable for full theater darkness

Wall-mounted sconces: indirect illumination along side walls

Accent LEDs: integrated into shelves, fireplace mantel, or under furniture edges for subtle glow

Decorative & Ambient Lighting

LED strips or rope lighting: behind velour curtains, under cabinets, or along coves

Color temperature & RGB options: can set warm white for cozy atmosphere or colored accents for thematic lighting

Timers & smart control: schedule lights to turn on/off or adjust automatically for pre-show ambiance

Placement Flexibility

Ceiling coves or tray ceilings

Behind acoustic panels for gentle wall wash

Floor or step LEDs along tiered seating

Around plant displays (canna lilies, bird of paradise, irises) to highlight greenery

Benefits

Maintain complete visual focus on screen while enhancing room warmth and style

Adjustable for different moods — movie mode, dinner with fireplace, or casual lounging

Energy-efficient and low-heat, so it won’t affect temperature or acoustic materials

If you want, I can generate a 3D rendering of the home theater showing the LED lighting in action along with OLED, 9.1 surround, fireplace, Stickley/Mission furniture, Pendleton wool accents, velour curtains, and plants. This would show both the functional and aesthetic effect of the LEDs.

Do you want me to do that next?

are you sure about "total theater darkness" ?  it's my understanding that maintaining some ambient red light is better visually

You’re correct — total darkness isn’t always ideal for human vision in a home theater. Here’s the nuance:

Visual Comfort in a Home Theater
Why Some Ambient Light Helps

Reduces eye strain

When the room is completely dark, pupils dilate fully. Moving your eyes from dark surroundings to a bright OLED can cause temporary discomfort or fatigue.

Improves peripheral orientation

A faint red glow along walls, steps, or furniture edges helps viewers navigate the space without looking away from the screen.

Preserves contrast perception

A subtle red ambient light doesn’t wash out the image because red light minimally stimulates rod cells responsible for night vision.

Implementation

Dimmable red LEDs: along floor, steps, or coves

Wall-mounted indirect red light: behind velour curtains or acoustic panels

Adjustable intensity: allow “movie mode” (very low red) vs. “pre-show mode” (slightly brighter)

Avoid white or blue ambient lighting: these can reduce perceived contrast on the screen

Recommended Intensity

<1–2 lux at seating positions — just enough to see outlines, not enough to interfere with OLED contrast.

So your LED setup is perfect, but the key is: use low-level red ambient light rather than full blackout. This gives comfort without sacrificing immersion.

If you want, I can update the previous 3D home theater concept to show subtle red ambient lighting integrated with your LEDs, while keeping velour curtains, OLED, 9.1 system, fireplace, and furniture accents.

Do you want me to do that?

okay, what else to you need to know about preferences?

Great — to make the house, listening room, kitchen, and theater fully aligned with your vision, here are the main preference areas we should clarify:

Indoor/outdoor plant integration?

Specific species or themes (tropical, native, floral accents)?

Once you clarify these, I can produce a fully integrated house plan — including floor plans, 3D renderings, and room adjacencies — that respects your acoustic, visual, and aesthetic priorities.

Do you want to go through each of these categories one by one, or focus only on rooms around the listening and theater spaces first?

well, open vs compartmentalized is difficult to answer, given that we're looking for immersion in both audio and video rooms.

That makes sense — your listening room and theater need acoustic isolation and immersive focus, which usually favors more compartmentalized, enclosed spaces, while other areas of the house could be more open and flowing.

We can think in terms of zoned openness:

Immersive Media Zones (Listening Room & Home Theater)

Fully enclosed with thick, acoustically isolated walls

Minimal open-plan adjacency to avoid noise bleed

Heavy doors, possible double-door vestibules for sound isolation

Controlled lighting (velour curtains, LED/red ambient lighting, blackout options)

Living & Kitchen/Dining Zones

Can be open-plan for natural flow, sightlines, and social interaction

Connection to kitchen, dining, and lounge areas for everyday use

Acoustic separation from media zones via hallways, partitions, or stairs

Transitional Spaces

Hallways, foyers, or buffer zones can dampen sound and create a clear separation between immersive media rooms and social areas

These can also serve as display or gallery spaces, keeping openness visually engaging without compromising acoustics

So, essentially:

Media rooms: compartmentalized, acoustically optimized, immersive

Living/entertainment/social spaces: open, airy, connected

Transitions: buffers for both sound and flow

If you want, I can draft a preliminary floorplan showing immersive media zones compartmentalized while keeping the kitchen, dining, and lounge areas open — giving a visual balance of isolation and flow.

Do you want me to do that next?

what else do you need for the theater room?

To fully realize the home theater with fireplace at the level of detail we’ve been doing, here’s what would be helpful to know about your preferences:

1. Screen & Viewing

Exact size of OLED (≥100" mentioned) — do you want ultra-wide or standard 16:9 aspect?

Position relative to fireplace — above, beside, or on a separate wall?

Viewing distance preferences (row-to-screen spacing for immersion)

2. Seating

Number of rows and seats per row

Tiered vs. single-level seating

Stickley/Mission-style style confirmed — any specific upholstery colors or Pendleton patterns?

Recliner functions: motorized or manual

3. Surround System

Exact speaker model/type if you have a preference (besides 9.1 layout)

Subwoofer quantity and preferred placement (corners, rear, or hidden)

Integration with fireplace materials (e.g., avoid resonance)

4. Fireplace

Type: gas or wood

Mantel and surround design: wood, stone, metal

Height and offset relative to screen

5. Acoustic Treatment

Amount of velour coverage desired on walls and ceiling

Preference for diffusers, panels, or a combination

Flooring: carpet, rug, or hardwood with rugs

6. Lighting

LED placement: floor, ceiling, coves, behind velour

Red ambient light: intensity, placement, adjustable or fixed

Dimmable zones for pre-show, movie, and post-show modes

7. Decor & Ambience

Plant placement: corners, near fireplace, or side walls?

Wall/furniture colors and textures

Any additional accessories (art, shelving, display cases)

Once these are clarified, I can produce a fully detailed 3D rendering and floor plan showing: OLED, 9.1 surround, fireplace, Stickley/Mission furniture, velour curtains, ambient LED lighting, and plants — all optimally arranged for immersion and visual aesthetics.

Do you want to go through these points one by one, or provide the high-level preferences in bulk?

i didn't say >100", i said >70"

Ah — thanks for clarifying. So the OLED screen is over 70″, not ≥100″. That changes room proportions, viewing distance, and seating layout slightly for optimal visual immersion.

Here’s the updated approach for your theater:

Screen & Viewing

OLED screen: >70″ diagonal, likely 16:9 aspect ratio

Viewing distance: ~1.5–2.5× the screen height for immersive experience without eye strain

Placement: can still be centered on front wall, fireplace visible on side or offset if desired

Seating

2–3 rows, depending on room depth (~25–30 ft)

Tiered or flat seating with Stickley/Mission-style framing

Pendleton wool accents on cushions and throws

Surround Sound

9.1 layout still applies

Subwoofer(s) placement adjusted for slightly smaller screen and listening distances

Acoustic & Visual Integration

Velour curtains, LED lighting, fireplace, and plants all remain

Room volume and wall treatments scaled for immersive sound even with a slightly smaller screen

So everything else stays consistent, just screen size and row distances are adjusted to match the >70″ OLED.

If you want, I can generate a new 3D rendering of the home theater reflecting the >70″ OLED and correct scaled seating. Do you want me to do that?

okay, my bad, >95" is fine.  and resize the room accordingly.

Perfect — now we’re aiming for a truly immersive home theater with a >95″ OLED. That requires slightly larger room dimensions to optimize viewing distance, seating layout, and audio performance.

Updated Home Theater Room Specs
Dimensions

Width: 18–22 ft (5.5–6.7 m) — wide enough for 2–3 rows of seating, side aisles, and 9.1 speaker placement

oh, also, are acoustics improved with a sloped ceiling?

Yes — a sloped or angled ceiling can improve acoustics, but it depends on how it’s designed. Here’s a breakdown:

Benefits of a Sloped Ceiling

Reduces Parallel Surfaces

Parallel walls and ceilings create standing waves and flutter echoes.

A sloped ceiling reduces this effect, improving clarity, especially in low-mid frequencies.

Improves Sound Diffusion

Angled surfaces scatter sound, helping to even out reflections across the room.

This can enhance imaging and soundstage, particularly for front-to-back speaker placement in a 9.1 system.

Helps Early Reflection Control

Ceiling angles can redirect early reflections away from listening positions, reducing comb filtering.

Considerations

Slope direction:

A gentle slope front-to-back (screen wall lower, rear wall higher) is usually ideal in theaters.

Avoid slope side-to-side if you want symmetric imaging.

Acoustic treatment:

Even with a slope, panels or clouds may still be needed at first-reflection points.

Bass traps in corners remain necessary for low-frequency control.

Construction & aesthetics:

A subtle sloped ceiling can add visual drama while enhancing acoustics.

Too steep or complex slopes can create dead spots or complicate lighting.

Recommendation for Your Theater

Slight front-to-back slope of ~6–12 inches over the 30–32 ft length:

Screen wall slightly lower, rear wall (fireplace wall) slightly higher

Maintain a flat plane for side walls to preserve stereo symmetry

Integrate acoustic clouds along ceiling to further smooth reflections

If you want, I can update the 3D rendering of your home theater to show a subtle sloped ceiling along with all your existing elements (OLED >95″, fireplace rear wall, 9.1 surround, Stickley/Mission seating, velour curtains, LEDs, plants).

Do you want me to do that?

so, both the theater and JBL room should used optimized ceiling angulation where appropriate

Exactly — both immersive audio spaces benefit from carefully angled ceilings, but each has slightly different goals:

1. JBL Everest Listening Room

Purpose: critical listening and reference-quality audio

Ceiling strategy:

Subtle slope or angled panels front-to-back or slightly side-to-side to reduce standing waves

Diffusers or angled acoustic clouds on ceiling to scatter reflections without coloring the sound

Keep symmetry where possible so stereo imaging remains accurate

Benefit: improves clarity, soundstage, and low-mid balance without compromising the natural tonal signature of the Everests

2. Home Theater (OLED + Fireplace)

Purpose: immersive cinema experience with visual and audio integration

Ceiling strategy:

Front-to-back gentle slope (screen wall slightly lower, rear/fireplace wall slightly higher)

Adds visual drama and helps reflections fall away from the screen

Ceiling clouds angled to reduce early reflections and flutter echoes

Benefit: smoother frequency response, better surround imaging, reduced echo, and enhanced room sense of depth

General Guidelines

Keep slope moderate (~6–12 inches over 30–32 ft for theater; smaller for JBL room depending on size)

Combine with diffusers, absorbers, and bass traps to fully control acoustics

Maintain symmetry for stereo/reference spaces; slight asymmetry can be okay for cinematic rooms to add natural diffusion

If you like, I can update both 3D renderings — the JBL Everest room and the home theater — to show optimized ceiling angulation with all your existing elements, so you can visualize the effect on each space.

Do you want me to do that?

okay, render the theater room
okay, now we need to work on a "sun" room ... which is light, bright, with plants ... a cozy place to nap, read, or eat breakfast
